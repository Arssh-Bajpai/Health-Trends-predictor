## Health Trends Predictor

### Overview
The **Health Trends Predictor** is a **data science and machine learning project** that analyzes historical medical data, lifestyle choices, and environmental factors to predict future health trends. It leverages statistical models and machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights into health-related outcomes.

### Features
- **Predictive analytics** for identifying health trends.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover correlations in health datasets.
- **Machine learning models** for health trend forecasting.
- **Visualization of insights** using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Jupyter Notebook-based implementation** for ease of reproducibility.

### Technologies Used
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)

### Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Health-Trends-Predictor
   cd Health-Trends-Predictor
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
